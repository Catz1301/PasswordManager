# PasswordManager
This is a simple password manager application for the Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Building
This was built with .NETcore 3.1, I am unsure if you can copy and paste code into a project using the .NET Framework, but you can give it a try. This will not be updated in the future (it's reverse sychology for me, the hope is that I **will** update it, now that I've said that I won't).

## Future Tasks
- [x] Save passwords to a file and read passwords from a file.<br>
- [x] Encrypt JSON serialized Dictionary of passwords, save it to a file; read encrypted JSON serialized Dictionary string, decrypt and deserialize back into a dictionary.<br>
- [ ] Save encrypted master password with rest of passwords.<br>
- [ ] Migrate to .NET Framework?<br>
